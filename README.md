jpgMv
=====
jpgMv renames a collection of jpg files so they have
names like 2005-10-13_00.jpg or 2005-10-13+15-15-46_00.jpg

jpgDate
=======
jpgDate to get the date, or date and time from a.jpg.
jpgDate uses the identify command from ImageMagic.

jpgMv is particularly useful when merging many photos into one directory;
it does not overwrite existing files.
